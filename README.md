# Library Management System

This is a simple library management system that aims to help libraries manage their inventory, loan records, and patrons in a more efficient way. The system provides an easy-to-use interface for librarians to manage books, borrowers, and loans, and for patrons to search for books, borrow books, and view their account information.

## Features

The library management system project includes the following features:

- Add, edit, and delete books in the system
- Track loaned books and due dates
- Search for books by title, author, or genre
- Access control with multiple user roles (e.g. librarian, patron)

## Technologies Used

The library management system project is built using the following technologies:

- React: for building the user interface
- Express.js: for building the web application framework
- Node.js: for server-side scripting and database connectivity
- PostgreSQL: for database management and storage
